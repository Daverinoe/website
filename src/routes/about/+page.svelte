	<h1>Who is Daverinoe?</h1>

	<p>
		I have had a rather round about path in life. My biggest career accomplishments so far 
		have been graduating with a PhD in computational quantum information, then moving into a software engineer
		position. But over the past year or two, I've really decided on what my hobby should be:
	</p>

	<p class="shaky">GAME DEVELOPMENT!</p>

	<p>
		I, like many many others, decided "Hey, games are fun to play! I bet they're fun to make!" and gave it a go.
		To my absolute delight, the challenges involved in game development are incredibly fun to work on,
		and give me a real sense of satisfaction to solve. From gameplay programming and making the perfect feeling 
		character controller, creating audio solutions that meet the needs of the game, to bashing my head repeatedly
		against the unyielding brick wall that is shader code.
	</p>

	<p>
		I enjoy all of it.
	</p>

	<p>
		So where's the proof? The proof, dear readers, is in my <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page. There, you'll
		find pages on every project I worked on, and a brief post-mortem of the challenges I overcame, and the problems
		I didn't. These are, one and all (as of writing on March 2023), game-jam games. A couple of my projects have 
		promise to become full-fledged releases with proper polish, but that remains to be seen.
	</p>

	<p>
		So enjoy, dear reader (and dare I say, friend?). I hope the walk through my game development career is 
		enlightening for you!
